# The True Destiny

## Introduction
This discord bot is a simple and lightweight bot written in python. It was designed to be easy to set up and use.

## Features
- Can roll single or multiple dice together
- Will display the addition of all the rolls
- Uses the number of microseconds since Jan 1st 1970 for sake of getting a more random roll

## Installation
To install this discord bot, follow these steps, (it only has been tested on a debian environment) :

1. Make sure you have python3, pip and discord.py installed
2. Clone the repository :`git clone https://github.com/Qvy-png/TheTrueDestiny.git`
3. Replace the token placeholder by your own token, generated from discord's dev portal : `https://discord.com/developers/`
4. Make sure to give your bot the correct rights : `Read Messages/View Channels, Send Messages, Manage Messages, Read Message History`
5. Run the command `make` to launch the bot. Once up and running, the message `Bot is online and connected to discord!` should be displayed
6. Have fun! 

## Usage
The main purpose of this discord bot is to roll dice to enable any DnD or RolePlay party to play online.

 - Open your discord server (where your bot has been invited) and run the following command : `:roll d6` ;
Congratulations, you have rolled your first dice! 
 - Now try `:roll 2d20`;
Wowee, you have rolled 2 20 dices. Felt good right ?

Feel free to contribute to your heart's content, the more features, the better !

## Future ?

I have in mind to create a playlist of medieval sounds, that will be easily played by the bot in a VC, during games.
